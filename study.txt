Scraping youtube

Can be done by accessing the following Url
Look for the script containing variable declaration ytInitialData
Content of search is in the property:
	- contents

Videoos can be watched at the following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<videoId>

Youtube-dl

Option 1:
Docker image: GitHub - mikenye/docker-youtube-dl: Youtube-DL container with all prerequisites (libav-tools, ffmpeg, rtmpdump, mplayer, mpv)


Can be configured by setting a config file: 
docker run \
    --rm -i \
    -e PGID=$(id -g)\
    -e PUID=$(id -u)\
    -v /path/to/downloaded/videos:/workdir:rw \
    -v /path/to/youtube-dl.conf:/etc/youtube-dl.conf:ro \
    ghcr.io/mikenye/docker-youtube-dl:latest

The config file can get all the options of the command line.
So I can add batch where batch is ConfigMap containing URLs of video to download

So this image can be used as an initContainer, that copy the content to a shared location
Then the main container can upload it to min.io

Option 2
Or create another image that download video based on an environment variable.
Start a spring console app that get the video and send it to min.io
Another app can create the corresponding k8s Job manifest to configure the env variable.
